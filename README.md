## Installation

[You'll need hyper first!](https://hyper.is/#installation).
After you have hyper, you will need to make sure that hyper is in your path (you can find that in the plugins menu). Then all you need to run is

```
hyper i doki-theme-hyper
```

Be sure to restart hyper afterwards.

## About!

With well over **20 themes** (light and dark) I think you will be able to find your favorite.
You can even find a theme that fits your mood for the day.

Variety is the spice of life! So you can choose themes from the following Doki-Doki Theme Suites:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Re:Zero
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba
- DanganRonpa
- High School DxD
- Lucky Star
- Sword Art Online

Sticker in the way?
No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.
